Selenium test script for downloading latest pdf in astrophysics research from arxiv.org
# Problem Statement:
1. Identify any website that regularly posts publicly accessible PDF files. Examples may include some government website that posts PDFs of notices and circulars, court websites that posts PDFs of judgements, arXiv or journal websites that posts PDFs of research papers, financial regulator website that posts PDFs of corporate filings, or any other website that regularly posts PDF files.

2. Use Selenium IDE to record a test automation to download the latest PDF posted on your chosen website. Your script must download the latest PDF posted when the script is run, and not hardcode the file to download.
